<p> Hi, my name is Kewal, I am from Nepal. Nepal is a very beautiful place to live. Firstly Nepali people are friendly, warm and welcoming people who are proud of our traditions, religion, music and culture. We have huge respect for visitors to our country; a phrase known by every Nepali is ‘Guests equals God’.  </p>
