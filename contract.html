<h1> Kewal Thapa WEB250-N801 Course Contract!</h1>


<p><b>I, Kewal Thapa agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my fall 2022 WEB250-N801 Database Driven Websites, with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or doing works. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</b></p>

I put four pictures in one place and upload that one frame under my paragraph. hope you will do the same as i did.</b></p>
