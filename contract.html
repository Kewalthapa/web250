<p>I, <a href="https://kewalthapa.github.io/web250/">Kewal Thapa</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my fall 2022 Web250 Database Driven Websites, with my instructor, D.I. Von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or doing works. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

<p>Signed, Kewal Thapa!       01/10/2022</p>

<p>This this the Github setup, that I screenshot and post it down for you to look up. This is how I did when I was setting the Github pages, for everyone to know about it, it's not that hard when you got the instructions. I did follow the instructions and as you can see, this is my result of all set-up. I put four pictures in one place and upload that one frame under my paragraph. hope you will do the same as i did.</p>
