	<h2> WEB250 Course Contract</h2>
	

<p>I, <a href="https://kewalthapa.github.io/web250/">Kewal Thapa</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my fall 2022 Web250 Database Driven Websites, with my instructor, D.I. Von Briesen.</p>

<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or doing works. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
