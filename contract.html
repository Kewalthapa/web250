<h1> Kewal Thapa WEB250-N801 Course Contract!</h1>


<p><b>I, Kewal Thapa agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my fall 2022 WEB250-N801 Database Driven Websites, with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or doing works. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</b></p>

<p>Signed, Kewal Thapa!       01/10/2022</p>



<h2> Workflow (Github Setup) </h2>


<p><b>This this the Github setup, that I screenshot and post it down for you to look up. This is how I did when I was setting the Github pages, for everyone to know about it, it's not that hard when you got the instructions. I did follow the instructions and as you can see, this is my result of all set-up. I put four pictures in one place and upload that one frame under my paragraph. hope you will do the same as i did.</b></p>
